üöÄ Project Overview
VeriHire is a modern, AI-powered hiring platform designed to fix the broken recruitment process. The core problem we solve is the "AI Trust Deficit"‚Äîwhere companies use AI tools that operate as a "black box," leading to uncertainty and potential bias.

Our mission is to provide an all-in-one platform that empowers, not replaces, human recruiters. We turn AI into a clear, understandable co-pilot that helps companies find the best talent with unparalleled speed, transparency, and integrity.

ü§ñ AI Integration Workflow
The core AI features of VeriHire are designed to run securely on the backend using serverless functions.

Resume Parsing:

A candidate uploads their resume to the Next.js frontend.

The file is securely uploaded to Supabase Storage.

This upload triggers a Supabase Edge Function.

The Edge Function securely calls an external AI API (like OpenAI), passing the resume content.

The AI service returns structured JSON data (skills, experience, etc.).

The Edge Function saves this structured data into the Supabase database, linking it to the candidate's profile.

Interview Question Generation:

When a candidate starts an interview, an Edge Function is called.

It receives the job description and the parsed resume data as input.

It sends this context to a powerful language model (like Grok or GPT-4) with a detailed prompt.

The model returns a tailored set of 15 interview questions (basic, intermediate, advanced).

These questions are then presented to the candidate one by one in the interview interface.
